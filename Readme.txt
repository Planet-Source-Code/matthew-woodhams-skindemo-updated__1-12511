                      Skin Demo!                     

Updates and fixes 11/11/00:    
                   
 I have updated the example a bit. I updated the 
move for (thanks to Joey Burgett).  I fixed the   
code in the OpenSkin sub, now if the user is a    
first time user it will load the default skin!
Because of a request i also made it so that
the form can be in the Windows task bar!    
I also updated the SkinBuilder, now you can make  
the exit and minimize buttons show or hide its    
captions and i added a new feature that allows you
'* to preview the skin in a form so that you know    
what the skin will look like (this is why the     
skinbuilder source is now in the "skin" directory)
And i also made 4 new Skins (Some graphics are from
SoftShape, view skin comments for more)!!                     


 Hi, this is an example of what i am using to skin
a project of mine. I have changed it a bit, but it
has most of the stuff my project has. Most of it  
is commented but if you need any help contact me. 
Special thanks to Dos, because i used some codes  
of his to make the form any shape.                 
Thanks a lot, hope this helps. please vote!
